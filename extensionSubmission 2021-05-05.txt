This Extension adds a Panel to display Patreon supporters. 
Panel: 
- It makes use of the Twitch Channel Id to get the Patrons and display them within the Panel. 
- If there are no Patreon settings saved for the Twitch channel it will display sample data in the Panel. 
- In Local Testing and Hosted Testing I was able to verify that the Panel works on my channel (https://www.twitch.tv/khaoztopsy)

Configuration:
- The Configuration page for this extension has a Login with Patreon button
