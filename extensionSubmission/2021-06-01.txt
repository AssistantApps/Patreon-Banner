This Extension adds a Panel to display Patreon supporters. 
Panel: 
- It makes use of the Twitch Channel Id to get the Patrons and display them within the Panel. 
- If there are no Patreon settings saved for the Twitch channel it will display a button linking to the channel's Patreon page. 
- In Local Testing and Hosted Testing I was able to verify that the Panel works on my channel (https://www.twitch.tv/khaoztopsy)

Configuration:
- The Configuration page for this extension has a Login with Patreon button
- Once logged in it displays the number of Patron supporters fetched as well as a url to use as a browser source
- Example of a url that a user would see once logged in: https://patreonbanner.com/display.html?guid=5eeab99c-16bf-40b4-a287-57955aedbfe8

Live:
- I will be live (3rd June) 10AM PDT till 3PM PDT
- I will be live Saturday (5th June) 10AM PDT till 3PM PDT

Changelog:
- The configure page has more configuration/customisation options .
  - The configure page is more secure.
  - I now generate a JWT token from Twitch Auth details gained from the Extension library, use that for sending data to the API.
- The Panel handles none to very few Patrons gracefully.
- Users are no longer directed to a channel's Patreon page.
